    "category": "Technology & Engineering",
    "description": "Reeds Introductions: Physics Wave Concepts for Marine Engineering Applications covers the fundamental theoretical maritime physics concepts which underpin electromagnetic wave and sonar principles as developed in most maritime-related courses, whether Naval, Coastguard or Merchant Marine engineering. For these reasons it is vital that maritime users have a basic understanding of the concepts upon which many essential modern sea-going sensors and communications devices now operate. Knowledge regarding electromagnetic waves and electromagnetic devices is an established merchant navy sea service requirement, particularly for the Standards in Training and Certification in Watchkeeping (STCW95) qualification in various Maritime Coastguard Agency exams, e.g. Marine Electrotechnology (as Chief Engineer and Second Engineer), as mandated by the UK Department for Transport. This short introductory book is written as simply as possible to support growing numbers of overseas students for whom English is not their first language. This volume provides a comprehensive study of maritime physics principles and provides a firm foundation prior to reading and studying of the following Reeds Marine Engineering series: Vols 1, 3, 6, 7, 14 and 15. Students having read this easy-to-read volume will be better prepared for the more in depth study of the other volumes listed.",

    "category": "Technology & Engineering",
    "description": "In the present monograph, we develop the kinetic theory of transport phenomena and relaxation processes in the flows of reacting gas mixtures and discuss its applications to strongly non-equilibrium conditions. The main attention is focused on the influence of non-equilibrium kinetics on gas dynamics and transport properties. Closed systems of fluid dynamic equations are derived from the kinetic equations in different approaches. We consider the most accurate approach taking into account the state-to-state kinetics in a flow, as well as simplified multi-temperature and one-temperature models based on quasi-stationary distributions. Within these approaches, we propose the algorithms for the calculation of the transport coefficients and rate coefficients of chemical reactions and energy exchanges in non-equilibrium flows; the developed techniques are based on the fundamental kinetic theory principles. The theory is applied to the modeling of non-equilibrium flows behind strong shock waves, in the boundary layer, and in nozzles. The comparison of the results obtained within the frame of different approaches is presented, the advantages of the new state-to-state kinetic model are discussed, and the limits of validity for simplified models are established. The book can be interesting for scientists and graduate students working on physical gas dynamics, aerothermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, non-equilibrium physical-chemical kinetics, and kinetic theory of gases.",

The reader will find a discussion of the concepts that are indispensable in scheduling and designing boreholes, along with the relevant equipment. Also covered are the techniques specific to implementing the equipment involved, optimizing drilling procedures and maintaining safety in operations. The book's chief objective is to provide the most information possible to all those who need a comprehensive understanding of the driller's aims and the resources he requires in producing and developing oil fields. It is particularly well-suited to the needs of the technical person whose field of activity is located upstream from oil and gas production, e.g. geologists, geophysicists, and reservoir and production facility engineers. It will also be of use to administrative personnel in oil companies, such as those in management, insurance and legal departments. The text is fully illustrated and consequently facilitates the reader's grasp of the basics of this highly technical profession.Contents: 1. Introduction. 2. Designing an oil well. 3. Downhole equipment. 4. The drilling rig. 5. Drilling fluids. 6. Wellheads. 7. Casing and cementing operations. 8. Measurements and drilling. 9. Principles of kick control. 10.

The models are the basis for the development of a systematic method for planning under balanced deep well drilling operations and for monitoring the drilling operation as well as construction project advances. Air and Gas Drilling Manual discusses both oil and natural gas industry applications, and geotechnical (water well, environmental, mining) industry applications. Important well construction and completion issues are discussed for all applications. The engineering analyses techniques are used to develop pre-operations planning methods, troubleshooting operations monitoring techniques and overall operations risk analysis. The essential objective of the book is drilling and well construction cost management control. The book is in both SI and British Imperial units. Master the air and gas drilling techniques in construction and development of water wells, monitoring wells, geotechnical boreholes, mining operations boreholes and more 30% of all wells drilled use gas and air, according to the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Contains basic simulation equations with examples for direct and reverse circulation drilling models and examples for air and gas, gasified fluids, and stable foam drilling models",

    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

    "description": "The third edition of Air and Gas Drilling Manual describes the basic simulation models for drilling deep wells with air or gas drilling fluids, gasified two-phase drilling fluids, and stable foam drilling fluids. The models are the basis for the development of a systematic method for planning under balanced deep well drilling operations and for monitoring the drilling operation as well as construction project advances. Air and Gas Drilling Manual discusses both oil and natural gas industry applications, and geotechnical (water well, environmental, mining) industry applications. Important well construction and completion issues are discussed for all applications. The engineering analyses techniques are used to develop pre-operations planning methods, troubleshooting operations monitoring techniques and overall operations risk analysis. The essential objective of the book is drilling and well construction cost management control. The book is in both SI and British Imperial units. Master the air and gas drilling techniques in construction and development of water wells, monitoring wells, geotechnical boreholes, mining operations boreholes and more 30% of all wells drilled use gas and air, according to the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Contains basic simulation equations with examples for direct and reverse circulation drilling models and examples for air and gas, gasified fluids, and stable foam drilling models",

    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

    "description": "The third edition of Air and Gas Drilling Manual describes the basic simulation models for drilling deep wells with air or gas drilling fluids, gasified two-phase drilling fluids, and stable foam drilling fluids. The models are the basis for the development of a systematic method for planning under balanced deep well drilling operations and for monitoring the drilling operation as well as construction project advances. Air and Gas Drilling Manual discusses both oil and natural gas industry applications, and geotechnical (water well, environmental, mining) industry applications. Important well construction and completion issues are discussed for all applications. The engineering analyses techniques are used to develop pre-operations planning methods, troubleshooting operations monitoring techniques and overall operations risk analysis. The essential objective of the book is drilling and well construction cost management control. The book is in both SI and British Imperial units. Master the air and gas drilling techniques in construction and development of water wells, monitoring wells, geotechnical boreholes, mining operations boreholes and more 30% of all wells drilled use gas and air, according to the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Contains basic simulation equations with examples for direct and reverse circulation drilling models and examples for air and gas, gasified fluids, and stable foam drilling models",

    "description": "The third edition of Air and Gas Drilling Manual describes the basic simulation models for drilling deep wells with air or gas drilling fluids, gasified two-phase drilling fluids, and stable foam drilling fluids. The models are the basis for the development of a systematic method for planning under balanced deep well drilling operations and for monitoring the drilling operation as well as construction project advances. Air and Gas Drilling Manual discusses both oil and natural gas industry applications, and geotechnical (water well, environmental, mining) industry applications. Important well construction and completion issues are discussed for all applications. The engineering analyses techniques are used to develop pre-operations planning methods, troubleshooting operations monitoring techniques and overall operations risk analysis. The essential objective of the book is drilling and well construction cost management control. The book is in both SI and British Imperial units. Master the air and gas drilling techniques in construction and development of water wells, monitoring wells, geotechnical boreholes, mining operations boreholes and more 30% of all wells drilled use gas and air, according to the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Contains basic simulation equations with examples for direct and reverse circulation drilling models and examples for air and gas, gasified fluids, and stable foam drilling models",

    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

    "description": "The third edition of Air and Gas Drilling Manual describes the basic simulation models for drilling deep wells with air or gas drilling fluids, gasified two-phase drilling fluids, and stable foam drilling fluids. The models are the basis for the development of a systematic method for planning under balanced deep well drilling operations and for monitoring the drilling operation as well as construction project advances. Air and Gas Drilling Manual discusses both oil and natural gas industry applications, and geotechnical (water well, environmental, mining) industry applications. Important well construction and completion issues are discussed for all applications. The engineering analyses techniques are used to develop pre-operations planning methods, troubleshooting operations monitoring techniques and overall operations risk analysis. The essential objective of the book is drilling and well construction cost management control. The book is in both SI and British Imperial units. Master the air and gas drilling techniques in construction and development of water wells, monitoring wells, geotechnical boreholes, mining operations boreholes and more 30% of all wells drilled use gas and air, according to the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Contains basic simulation equations with examples for direct and reverse circulation drilling models and examples for air and gas, gasified fluids, and stable foam drilling models",

It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

The models are the basis for the development of a systematic method for planning under balanced deep well drilling operations and for monitoring the drilling operation as well as construction project advances. Air and Gas Drilling Manual discusses both oil and natural gas industry applications, and geotechnical (water well, environmental, mining) industry applications. Important well construction and completion issues are discussed for all applications. The engineering analyses techniques are used to develop pre-operations planning methods, troubleshooting operations monitoring techniques and overall operations risk analysis. The essential objective of the book is drilling and well construction cost management control. The book is in both SI and British Imperial units. Master the air and gas drilling techniques in construction and development of water wells, monitoring wells, geotechnical boreholes, mining operations boreholes and more 30% of all wells drilled use gas and air, according to the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Contains basic simulation equations with examples for direct and reverse circulation drilling models and examples for air and gas, gasified fluids, and stable foam drilling models",

    "title": "Automated/Mechanized Drilling and Countersinking of Airframes",
    "category": "Technology & Engineering",
    "description": "Modern aircraft manufacturing involves drilling and countersinking hundreds of thousands to millions of holes. Doing this work by hand accounts for 65 of the cost of airframe assembly, 85 of the quality issues, and 80% of the lost time due to injuries. Automated drilling and countersinking replaces traditional hand methods and involves using numeric control machinery to drill and countersink a finished hole \"e;one shot\"e; (drilling a finished hole without using pilot holes or tool changes). This is a proven cost reducing technology that improves quality where it has been applied successfully. The focus of this book is on automating the process of drilling and countersinking holes during airframe manufacturing. Since this is the area of greatest return on investment for airframe producers, the book provides a stepped approach for evaluating possible areas for applying automation and a detailed description of the process for choosing, acquiring, and transitioning the right machinery for success. It also provides a vision for a 10- to 15-year future state of airframe manufacture. Readers will use the information to: Understand the evolution of automated/mechanized drilling and countersinking airframes; Access decision models and matrices to help evaluate the feasibility of applying automation/mechanization to any airframe; Gain access to a step-by-step procedure to select the right piece of machinery; Learn the necessary processes for testing and transitioning machinery to production; Assess and acquire data to evaluate the effect of the process; Choose and train the right individuals to manage and run the machinery; Conduct cost benefit analysis models; Make recommendations for maintenance and spares; Address socio-economic factors to reconfigure a facility from hand to automated activities. No other book provides such detailed technical, economic, and social information about automating the single largest contributor to airframe cost.",

Written by a team of more than 20 of the world's foremost drilling experts, from such companies as Shell, Conoco, Amoco, and BP There has never been a book that pulls together such a vast array of materials and depth of topic coverage in the area of drilling fluids Covers quickly changing technology that updates the drilling engineer on all of the latest equipment, fluids, and techniques",

    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",

    "title": "Automated/Mechanized Drilling and Countersinking of Airframes",
    "category": "Technology & Engineering",
    "description": "Modern aircraft manufacturing involves drilling and countersinking hundreds of thousands to millions of holes. Doing this work by hand accounts for 65 of the cost of airframe assembly, 85 of the quality issues, and 80% of the lost time due to injuries. Automated drilling and countersinking replaces traditional hand methods and involves using numeric control machinery to drill and countersink a finished hole \"e;one shot\"e; (drilling a finished hole without using pilot holes or tool changes). This is a proven cost reducing technology that improves quality where it has been applied successfully. The focus of this book is on automating the process of drilling and countersinking holes during airframe manufacturing. Since this is the area of greatest return on investment for airframe producers, the book provides a stepped approach for evaluating possible areas for applying automation and a detailed description of the process for choosing, acquiring, and transitioning the right machinery for success. It also provides a vision for a 10- to 15-year future state of airframe manufacture. Readers will use the information to: Understand the evolution of automated/mechanized drilling and countersinking airframes; Access decision models and matrices to help evaluate the feasibility of applying automation/mechanization to any airframe; Gain access to a step-by-step procedure to select the right piece of machinery; Learn the necessary processes for testing and transitioning machinery to production; Assess and acquire data to evaluate the effect of the process; Choose and train the right individuals to manage and run the machinery; Conduct cost benefit analysis models; Make recommendations for maintenance and spares; Address socio-economic factors to reconfigure a facility from hand to automated activities. No other book provides such detailed technical, economic, and social information about automating the single largest contributor to airframe cost.",

    "title": "Automated/Mechanized Drilling and Countersinking of Airframes",
    "category": "Technology & Engineering",
    "description": "Modern aircraft manufacturing involves drilling and countersinking hundreds of thousands to millions of holes. Doing this work by hand accounts for 65 of the cost of airframe assembly, 85 of the quality issues, and 80% of the lost time due to injuries. Automated drilling and countersinking replaces traditional hand methods and involves using numeric control machinery to drill and countersink a finished hole \"e;one shot\"e; (drilling a finished hole without using pilot holes or tool changes). This is a proven cost reducing technology that improves quality where it has been applied successfully. The focus of this book is on automating the process of drilling and countersinking holes during airframe manufacturing. Since this is the area of greatest return on investment for airframe producers, the book provides a stepped approach for evaluating possible areas for applying automation and a detailed description of the process for choosing, acquiring, and transitioning the right machinery for success. It also provides a vision for a 10- to 15-year future state of airframe manufacture. Readers will use the information to: Understand the evolution of automated/mechanized drilling and countersinking airframes; Access decision models and matrices to help evaluate the feasibility of applying automation/mechanization to any airframe; Gain access to a step-by-step procedure to select the right piece of machinery; Learn the necessary processes for testing and transitioning machinery to production; Assess and acquire data to evaluate the effect of the process; Choose and train the right individuals to manage and run the machinery; Conduct cost benefit analysis models; Make recommendations for maintenance and spares; Address socio-economic factors to reconfigure a facility from hand to automated activities. No other book provides such detailed technical, economic, and social information about automating the single largest contributor to airframe cost.",

    "title": "Imperial College Lectures In Petroleum Engineering, The - Volume 4: Drilling And Reservoir Appraisal",
    "category": "Technology & Engineering",
    "description": "This book covers the fundamentals of drilling and reservoir appraisal for petroleum. Split into three sections, the first looks at the basic principles of well engineering in terms of planning, design and construction. It then goes on to describe well safety, costs and operations management. The second section is focussed on drilling and core analysis, and the laboratory measurement of the physico-chemical properties of samples. It is clear that efficient development of hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on understanding these key properties, and the data can only be gathered through a carefully conducted core-analysis program, as described. Finally, in the third section we look at production logging, an essential part of reservoir appraisal, which describes the nature and the behaviour of fluids in or around the borehole. It describes how to know, at a given time, phase by phase, and zone by zone, how much fluid is coming out of or going into the formation.As part of the Imperial College Lectures in Petroleum Engineering, and based on a lecture series on the same topic, Drilling and Reservoir Appraisal provides the introductory information needed for students of the earth sciences, petroleum engineering, engineering and geoscience.",
