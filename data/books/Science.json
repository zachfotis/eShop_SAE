    "description": "This book offers a thorough reanalysis of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species, which for many people represents the work that alone gave rise to evolutionism. Of course, scholars today know better than that. Yet, few resist the temptation of turning to the Origin in order to support it or reject it in light of their own work. Apparently, Darwin fills the mythical role of a founding figure that must either be invoked or repudiated. The book is an invitation to move beyond what is currently expected of Darwin's magnum opus. Once the rhetorical varnish of Darwin's discourses is removed, one discovers a work of remarkably indecisive conclusions. The book comprises two main theses: (1) The Origin of Species never remotely achieved the theoretical unity to which it is often credited. Rather, Darwin was overwhelmed by a host of phenomena that could not fit into his narrow conceptual framework. (2) In the Origin of Species, Darwin failed at completing the full conversion to evolutionism. Carrying many ill-designed intellectual tools of the 17th and 18th centuries, Darwin merely promoted a special brand of evolutionism, one that prevented him from taking the decisive steps toward an open and modern evolutionism. It makes an interesting read for biologists, historians and philosophers alike.",

The formalisms are also kept self-contained. Most of the required mathematical tools are also given in the appendices. Although this book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, the book is concise and can be treated as an integrated entity.

    "description": "This book starts from a set of common basic principles to establish the formalisms in all areas of fundamental physics, including quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, general relativity, electromagnetic field, and classical mechanics. Instead of the traditional pedagogic way, the author arranges the subjects and formalisms in a logical-sequential way, i.e. all the formulas are derived from the formulas before them. The formalisms are also kept self-contained. Most of the required mathematical tools are also given in the appendices. Although this book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, the book is concise and can be treated as an integrated entity. This is consistent with the aphorism that simplicity is beauty, unification is beauty, and thus physics is beauty. The book may be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students. It is also suitable for physicists who wish to have an overview of fundamental physics.",

    "description": "This book starts from a set of common basic principles to establish the formalisms in all areas of fundamental physics, including quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, general relativity, electromagnetic field, and classical mechanics. Instead of the traditional pedagogic way, the author arranges the subjects and formalisms in a logical-sequential way, i.e. all the formulas are derived from the formulas before them. The formalisms are also kept self-contained. Most of the required mathematical tools are also given in the appendices. Although this book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, the book is concise and can be treated as an integrated entity. This is consistent with the aphorism that simplicity is beauty, unification is beauty, and thus physics is beauty. The book may be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students. It is also suitable for physicists who wish to have an overview of fundamental physics.",

    "category": "Science",
    "description": "Ozone, an important trace component, is critical to life on Earth and to atmospheric chemistry. The presence of ozone profoundly impacts the physical structure of the atmosphere and meteorology. Ozone is also an important photolytic source for HO radicals, the driving force for most of the chemistry that occurs in the lower atmosphere, is essential to shielding biota, and is the only molecule in the atmosphere that provides protection from UV radiation in the 250-300 nm region. However, recent concerns regarding environmental issues have inspired a need for a greater understanding of ozone, and the effects that it has on the Earth's atmosphere. The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone provides an overview of the chemical processes associated with the formation and loss of ozone in the atmosphere, meeting the need for a greater body of knowledge regarding atmospheric chemistry. Renowned atmospheric researcher Jack Calvert and his coauthors discuss the various chemical and physical properties of the earth's atmosphere, the ways in which ozone is formed and destroyed, and the mechanisms of various ozone chemical reactions in the different spheres of the atmosphere. The volume is rich with valuable knowledge and useful descriptions, and will appeal to environmental scientists and engineers alike. A thorough analysis of the processes related to tropospheric ozone, The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone is an essential resource for those hoping to combat the continuing and future environmental problems, particularly issues that require a deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry.",

The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone provides an overview of the chemical processes associated with the formation and loss of ozone in the atmosphere, meeting the need for a greater body of knowledge regarding atmospheric chemistry. Renowned atmospheric researcher Jack Calvert and his coauthors discuss the various chemical and physical properties of the earth's atmosphere, the ways in which ozone is formed and destroyed, and the mechanisms of various ozone chemical reactions in the different spheres of the atmosphere. The volume is rich with valuable knowledge and useful descriptions, and will appeal to environmental scientists and engineers alike. A thorough analysis of the processes related to tropospheric ozone, The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone is an essential resource for those hoping to combat the continuing and future environmental problems, particularly issues that require a deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry.",

All chapters include an introduction, history and mechanism of the name reaction, and present the origin of the natural product and its known biological activities. The pathway to total synthesis is visually illustrated, and the focus is on the step in which a name reaction is applied. Chemists working in the area of synthetic organic chemistry will find this reference useful, as well as those working to develop novel methodologies for the synthesis of natural products in both academia and industry. This book is also beneficial to biologists, pharmacists and botanists. Includes an introduction of alkaloids, their origins and biological properties Features the applications of special name reactions as the key step in the total synthesis of featured alkaloids Covers the pathway for the synthesis of alkaloids from commercially available or easily accessible starting materials by using at least one name reaction to achieve the desired target products",

    "title": "The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone",
    "category": "Science",
    "description": "Ozone, an important trace component, is critical to life on Earth and to atmospheric chemistry. The presence of ozone profoundly impacts the physical structure of the atmosphere and meteorology. Ozone is also an important photolytic source for HO radicals, the driving force for most of the chemistry that occurs in the lower atmosphere, is essential to shielding biota, and is the only molecule in the atmosphere that provides protection from UV radiation in the 250-300 nm region. However, recent concerns regarding environmental issues have inspired a need for a greater understanding of ozone, and the effects that it has on the Earth's atmosphere. The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone provides an overview of the chemical processes associated with the formation and loss of ozone in the atmosphere, meeting the need for a greater body of knowledge regarding atmospheric chemistry. Renowned atmospheric researcher Jack Calvert and his coauthors discuss the various chemical and physical properties of the earth's atmosphere, the ways in which ozone is formed and destroyed, and the mechanisms of various ozone chemical reactions in the different spheres of the atmosphere. The volume is rich with valuable knowledge and useful descriptions, and will appeal to environmental scientists and engineers alike. A thorough analysis of the processes related to tropospheric ozone, The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone is an essential resource for those hoping to combat the continuing and future environmental problems, particularly issues that require a deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry.",

Since chiral inductions are necessary for most of these sequential name reactions, their asymmetric catalyzed reactions are also described. Includes the synthesis of many heterocycles, which is ideal for synthetic organic chemists engaged in the synthesis of heterocyclic systems Covers the recent advances of asymmetric synthesis of a wide range of heterocycles in satisfactory enantioselectivities (ees) or distereoselectivities (des) Reviews the synthesis of a wide variety of interesting heterocycles by using a combination of different and versatile name reactions via MCRs",

    "category": "Science",
    "description": "Ozone, an important trace component, is critical to life on Earth and to atmospheric chemistry. The presence of ozone profoundly impacts the physical structure of the atmosphere and meteorology. Ozone is also an important photolytic source for HO radicals, the driving force for most of the chemistry that occurs in the lower atmosphere, is essential to shielding biota, and is the only molecule in the atmosphere that provides protection from UV radiation in the 250-300 nm region. However, recent concerns regarding environmental issues have inspired a need for a greater understanding of ozone, and the effects that it has on the Earth's atmosphere. The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone provides an overview of the chemical processes associated with the formation and loss of ozone in the atmosphere, meeting the need for a greater body of knowledge regarding atmospheric chemistry. Renowned atmospheric researcher Jack Calvert and his coauthors discuss the various chemical and physical properties of the earth's atmosphere, the ways in which ozone is formed and destroyed, and the mechanisms of various ozone chemical reactions in the different spheres of the atmosphere. The volume is rich with valuable knowledge and useful descriptions, and will appeal to environmental scientists and engineers alike. A thorough analysis of the processes related to tropospheric ozone, The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone is an essential resource for those hoping to combat the continuing and future environmental problems, particularly issues that require a deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry.",

The presence of ozone profoundly impacts the physical structure of the atmosphere and meteorology. Ozone is also an important photolytic source for HO radicals, the driving force for most of the chemistry that occurs in the lower atmosphere, is essential to shielding biota, and is the only molecule in the atmosphere that provides protection from UV radiation in the 250-300 nm region.

    "title": "The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone",
    "category": "Science",
    "description": "Ozone, an important trace component, is critical to life on Earth and to atmospheric chemistry. The presence of ozone profoundly impacts the physical structure of the atmosphere and meteorology. Ozone is also an important photolytic source for HO radicals, the driving force for most of the chemistry that occurs in the lower atmosphere, is essential to shielding biota, and is the only molecule in the atmosphere that provides protection from UV radiation in the 250-300 nm region. However, recent concerns regarding environmental issues have inspired a need for a greater understanding of ozone, and the effects that it has on the Earth's atmosphere. The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone provides an overview of the chemical processes associated with the formation and loss of ozone in the atmosphere, meeting the need for a greater body of knowledge regarding atmospheric chemistry. Renowned atmospheric researcher Jack Calvert and his coauthors discuss the various chemical and physical properties of the earth's atmosphere, the ways in which ozone is formed and destroyed, and the mechanisms of various ozone chemical reactions in the different spheres of the atmosphere. The volume is rich with valuable knowledge and useful descriptions, and will appeal to environmental scientists and engineers alike. A thorough analysis of the processes related to tropospheric ozone, The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone is an essential resource for those hoping to combat the continuing and future environmental problems, particularly issues that require a deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry.",

    "title": "The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone",
    "category": "Science",
    "description": "Ozone, an important trace component, is critical to life on Earth and to atmospheric chemistry. The presence of ozone profoundly impacts the physical structure of the atmosphere and meteorology. Ozone is also an important photolytic source for HO radicals, the driving force for most of the chemistry that occurs in the lower atmosphere, is essential to shielding biota, and is the only molecule in the atmosphere that provides protection from UV radiation in the 250-300 nm region. However, recent concerns regarding environmental issues have inspired a need for a greater understanding of ozone, and the effects that it has on the Earth's atmosphere. The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone provides an overview of the chemical processes associated with the formation and loss of ozone in the atmosphere, meeting the need for a greater body of knowledge regarding atmospheric chemistry. Renowned atmospheric researcher Jack Calvert and his coauthors discuss the various chemical and physical properties of the earth's atmosphere, the ways in which ozone is formed and destroyed, and the mechanisms of various ozone chemical reactions in the different spheres of the atmosphere. The volume is rich with valuable knowledge and useful descriptions, and will appeal to environmental scientists and engineers alike. A thorough analysis of the processes related to tropospheric ozone, The Mechanisms of Reactions Influencing Atmospheric Ozone is an essential resource for those hoping to combat the continuing and future environmental problems, particularly issues that require a deeper understanding of atmospheric chemistry.",
    "shortDescription": "One of the photolysis <b>reactions</b> of ozone produces an excited oxygen atom, O(1D), and a small fraction of these <b>react</b> to produce HO, as discussed previously. The production of HO through the photolysis of CH2O is a more complex process.",

The book reviews recent applications of name reactions in multicomponents for the synthesis of heterocycles and examines recent advances in applications of significant name reactions, such as Ugi and Passirini, Click, Knoevenagel, Michael, Diels-Alder, Aldol, Mannich, Heck, Huisgen, and Suzuki in MCRs. These reactions can be used in the synthesis of a wide variety of novel heterocycles with different sizes and heteroatoms, as well as in the total synthesis of natural products in order to decrease the number of synthetic steps. Since chiral inductions are necessary for most of these sequential name reactions, their asymmetric catalyzed reactions are also described. Includes the synthesis of many heterocycles, which is ideal for synthetic organic chemists engaged in the synthesis of heterocyclic systems Covers the recent advances of asymmetric synthesis of a wide range of heterocycles in satisfactory enantioselectivities (ees) or distereoselectivities (des) Reviews the synthesis of a wide variety of interesting heterocycles by using a combination of different and versatile name reactions via MCRs",

This recent technology offers important products for geophysical control of drilling. It involves aspects typical of borehole seismics and of the drilling control surveying, hitherto the sole domain of mudlogging. For aspects related to the drill-bit source performance and borehole acoustics, the book attempts to provide a connection between experts working in geophysics and in drilling. There are different ways of thinking related to basic knowledge, operational procedures and precision in the observation of the physical quantities. The goal of the book is to help \"build a bridge\" between geophysicists involved in seismic while drilling - who may need to familiarize themselves with methods and procedures of drilling and drilling-rock mechanics - and drillers involved in geosteering and drilling of \"smart wells\" - who may have to familiarize themselves with seismic signals, wave resolution and radiation. For instance, an argument of common interest for drilling and seismic while drilling studies is the monitoring of the drill-string and bit vibrations. This volume contains a large number of real examples of SWD data analysis and applications.",

Even as alternative and renewable sources are developed, petroleum and natural gas continue to be, by far, the most used and, if engineered properly, the most cost-effective and efficient, source of energy on the planet. Drilling engineering is one of the most important links in the energy chain, being, after all, the science of getting the resources out of the ground for processing. Without drilling engineering, there would be no gasoline, jet fuel, and the myriad of other “have to have” products that people use all over the world every day. Following up on their previous books, also available from Wiley-Scrivener, the authors, two of the most well-respected, prolific, and progressive drilling engineers in the industry, offer this groundbreaking volume. They cover the basics tenets of drilling engineering, the most common problems that the drilling engineer faces day to day, and cutting-edge new technology and processes through their unique lens. Written to reflect the new, changing world that we live in, this fascinating new volume offers a treasure of knowledge for the veteran engineer, new hire, or student. This book is an excellent resource for petroleum engineering students, reservoir engineers, supervisors & managers, researchers and environmental engineers for planning every aspect of rig operations in the most sustainable, environmentally responsible manner, using the most up-to-date technological advancements in equipment and processes.",

This recent technology offers important products for geophysical control of drilling. It involves aspects typical of borehole seismics and of the drilling control surveying, hitherto the sole domain of mudlogging. For aspects related to the drill-bit source performance and borehole acoustics, the book attempts to provide a connection between experts working in geophysics and in drilling. There are different ways of thinking related to basic knowledge, operational procedures and precision in the observation of the physical quantities. The goal of the book is to help \"build a bridge\" between geophysicists involved in seismic while drilling - who may need to familiarize themselves with methods and procedures of drilling and drilling-rock mechanics - and drillers involved in geosteering and drilling of \"smart wells\" - who may have to familiarize themselves with seismic signals, wave resolution and radiation. For instance, an argument of common interest for drilling and seismic while drilling studies is the monitoring of the drill-string and bit vibrations. This volume contains a large number of real examples of SWD data analysis and applications.",

    "description": "Petroleum and natural gas still remain the single biggest resource for energy on earth. Even as alternative and renewable sources are developed, petroleum and natural gas continue to be, by far, the most used and, if engineered properly, the most cost-effective and efficient, source of energy on the planet. Drilling engineering is one of the most important links in the energy chain, being, after all, the science of getting the resources out of the ground for processing. Without drilling engineering, there would be no gasoline, jet fuel, and the myriad of other “have to have” products that people use all over the world every day. Following up on their previous books, also available from Wiley-Scrivener, the authors, two of the most well-respected, prolific, and progressive drilling engineers in the industry, offer this groundbreaking volume. They cover the basics tenets of drilling engineering, the most common problems that the drilling engineer faces day to day, and cutting-edge new technology and processes through their unique lens. Written to reflect the new, changing world that we live in, this fascinating new volume offers a treasure of knowledge for the veteran engineer, new hire, or student. This book is an excellent resource for petroleum engineering students, reservoir engineers, supervisors & managers, researchers and environmental engineers for planning every aspect of rig operations in the most sustainable, environmentally responsible manner, using the most up-to-date technological advancements in equipment and processes.",

Even as alternative and renewable sources are developed, petroleum and natural gas continue to be, by far, the most used and, if engineered properly, the most cost-effective and efficient, source of energy on the planet. Drilling engineering is one of the most important links in the energy chain, being, after all, the science of getting the resources out of the ground for processing.

Even as alternative and renewable sources are developed, petroleum and natural gas continue to be, by far, the most used and, if engineered properly, the most cost-effective and efficient, source of energy on the planet. Drilling engineering is one of the most important links in the energy chain, being, after all, the science of getting the resources out of the ground for processing. Without drilling engineering, there would be no gasoline, jet fuel, and the myriad of other “have to have” products that people use all over the world every day. Following up on their previous books, also available from Wiley-Scrivener, the authors, two of the most well-respected, prolific, and progressive drilling engineers in the industry, offer this groundbreaking volume. They cover the basics tenets of drilling engineering, the most common problems that the drilling engineer faces day to day, and cutting-edge new technology and processes through their unique lens. Written to reflect the new, changing world that we live in, this fascinating new volume offers a treasure of knowledge for the veteran engineer, new hire, or student.

Without drilling engineering, there would be no gasoline, jet fuel, and the myriad of other “have to have” products that people use all over the world every day. Following up on their previous books, also available from Wiley-Scrivener, the authors, two of the most well-respected, prolific, and progressive drilling engineers in the industry, offer this groundbreaking volume. They cover the basics tenets of drilling engineering, the most common problems that the drilling engineer faces day to day, and cutting-edge new technology and processes through their unique lens. Written to reflect the new, changing world that we live in, this fascinating new volume offers a treasure of knowledge for the veteran engineer, new hire, or student. This book is an excellent resource for petroleum engineering students, reservoir engineers, supervisors & managers, researchers and environmental engineers for planning every aspect of rig operations in the most sustainable, environmentally responsible manner, using the most up-to-date technological advancements in equipment and processes.",

    "description": "Formulas and Calculations for Drilling, Production, and Workover: All the Formulas You Need to Solve Drilling and Production Problems, Third Edition, provides a convenient source of reference for oil field workers who do not use formulas and calculations on a regular basis. This book is still intended for the entirety of their careers. It also aims to help reduce the volume of materials they must carry to the rig floor or job site. Starting with review of basic equations and basic calculations, the remaining chapters offer in-depth discussions of topics such as drilling fluids, pressure control, engineering calculations, and air and gas calculations. The formulas and calculations are provided in either English field units or in metric units. This edition includes the Volumetric Procedure, the Lubricate and Bleed Procedure (both Volume and Pressure Methods), and stripping procedures (both the Strip and Bleed Procedure and the Combined Stripping and Volumetric Procedure). The Table of Contents and the Index make looking up formulas and calculations quick and easy. Examples are used throughout to make the formulas as easy as possible to understand and work, and often exact words are used rather than symbols. Back-of-the envelope calculations that save time and money Easily evaluate the performance of your well Confidently design or redesign operations that will improve production Handle special production projects with ease",

    "category": "Science",
    "description": "This book provides a review of thermal ice drilling technologies, including the design, parameters, and performance of various tools and drills for making holes in ice sheets, ice caps, mountain glaciers, ice shelves, and sea ice. In recent years, interest in thermal drilling technology has increased as a result of subglacial lake explorations and extraterrestrial investigations. The book focuses on the latest ice drilling technologies, but also discusses the historical development of ice drilling tools and devices over the last 100 years to offer valuable insights into what is possible and what not to do in the future. Featuring numerous figures and pictures, many of them published for the first time, it is intended for specialists working in ice-core sciences, polar oceanography, drilling engineers and glaciologists, and is also a useful reference for researchers and graduate students working in engineering and cold-regions technology.",
