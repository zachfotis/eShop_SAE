    "description": "We study these new Smarandache algebraic structures, which are defined as structures which have a proper subset which has a weak structure.A Smarandache Weak Structure on a set S means a structure on S that has a proper subset P with a weaker structure.By proper subset of a set S, we mean a subset P of S, different from the empty set, from the original set S, and from the idempotent elements if any.A Smarandache Strong Structure on a set S means a structure on S that has a proper subset P with a stronger structure.A Smarandache Strong-Weak Structure on a set S means a structure on S that has two proper subsets: P with a stronger structure, and Q with a weaker structure.",
    "shortDescription": "Another class of S-definite special linear <b>algebra</b> is given by the following theorem. THEOREM 3.3.4: Let V = u uu! Q Q Q be a linear <b>algebra</b> ntimes over Q. V is a S-definite special linear <b>algebra</b> of S- definite dimension n.",
