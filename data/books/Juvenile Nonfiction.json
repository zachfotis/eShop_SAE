    "description": "This is one of the rare books on English which covers every aspect of the language—vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar and punctuation. It will open a new chapter in the learning process of every student. English is not so easy to learn as claimed by certain fly-by-night teaching centres, but every effort has been made in this book to understand the nuances of the language—and fast. English is one of the richest languages. It has borrowed extensively from all the major languages in the world, including Hindi. Mantra, chutney, dosa, etc have now become English words. A separate list of foreign words is given in this book. Twenty students have ‘left’ the class means gone out of the class. Twenty students are ‘left’ in the class means remained in the class. ‘That’s life’ means bad/hard life while ‘This is the life’ means good life. A fat chance or a slim chance have the same meaning. Such oddities have been explained in the book quite clearly. This book will be useful not only for students but for all who want to learn English from A to Z and want to use the language with authority.",
