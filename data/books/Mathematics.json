    "description": "The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel & Readiness), referred to throughout this report as P&R, is responsible for the total force management of all Department of Defense (DoD) components including the recruitment, readiness, and retention of personnel. Its work and policies are supported by a number of organizations both within DoD, including the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and externally, including the federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) that work for DoD. P&R must be able to answer questions for the Secretary of Defense such as how to recruit people with an aptitude for and interest in various specialties and along particular career tracks and how to assess on an ongoing basis service members' career satisfaction and their ability to meet new challenges. P&R must also address larger-scale questions, such as how the current realignment of forces to the Asia-Pacific area and other regions will affect recruitment, readiness, and retention. While DoD makes use of large-scale data and mathematical analysis in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and elsewhereâ€\"exploiting techniques such as complex network analysis, machine learning, streaming social media analysis, and anomaly detectionâ€\"these skills and capabilities have not been applied as well to the personnel and readiness enterprise. Strengthening Data Science Methods for Department of Defense Personnel and Readiness Missions offers and roadmap and implementation plan for the integration of data analysis in support of decisions within the purview of P&R.",

    "description": "Lectures in General Algebra is a translation from the Russian and is based on lectures on specialized courses in general algebra at Moscow University. The book starts with the basics of algebra. The text briefly describes the theory of sets, binary relations, equivalence relations, partial ordering, minimum condition, and theorems equivalent to the axiom of choice. The text gives the definition of binary algebraic operation and the concepts of groups, groupoids, and semigroups. The book examines the parallelism between the theory of groups and the theory of rings; such examinations show the convenience of constructing a single theory from the results of group experiments and ring experiments which are known to follow simple corollaries. The text also presents algebraic structures that are not of binary nature. From this parallelism arise other concepts, such as that of the lattices, complete lattices, and modular lattices. The book then proves the Schmidt-Ore theorem, and also describes linear algebra, as well as the Birkhoff-Witt theorem on Lie algebras. The text also addresses ordered groups, the Archimedean groups and rings, and Albert's theorem on normed algebras. This book can prove useful for algebra students and for professors of algebra and advanced mathematicians.",

    "title": "Vertex Algebras and Algebraic Curves: Second Edition",
    "category": "Mathematics",
    "description": "Vertex algebras are algebraic objects that encapsulate the concept of operator product expansion from two-dimensional conformal field theory. Vertex algebras are fast becoming ubiquitous in many areas of modern mathematics, with applications to representation theory, algebraic geometry, the theory of finite groups, modular functions, topology, integrable systems, and combinatorics. This book is an introduction to the theory of vertex algebras with a particular emphasis on the relationship with the geometry of algebraic curves. The notion of a vertex algebra is introduced in a coordinate-independent way, so that vertex operators become well defined on arbitrary smooth algebraic curves, possibly equipped with additional data, such as a vector bundle. Vertex algebras then appear as the algebraic objects encoding the geometric structure of various moduli spaces associated with algebraic curves. Therefore they may be used to give a geometric interpretation of various questions of representation theory. The book contains many original results, introduces important new concepts, and brings new insights into the theory of vertex algebras. The authors have made a great effort to make the book self-contained and accessible to readers of all backgrounds. Reviewers of the first edition anticipated that it would have a long-lasting influence on this exciting field of mathematics and would be very useful for graduate students and researchers interested in the subject. This second edition, substantially improved and expanded, includes several new topics, in particular an introduction to the Beilinson-Drinfeld theory of factorization algebras and the geometric Langlands correspondence.",

A state-of-the-art presentation of spatio-temporal processes, bridging classic ideas with modern hierarchical statistical modeling concepts and the latest computational methods Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle, are also winners of the 2011 PROSE Award in the Mathematics category, for the book “Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data” (2011), published by John Wiley and Sons. (The PROSE awards, for Professional and Scholarly Excellence, are given by the Association of American Publishers, the national trade association of the US book publishing industry.) Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data has now been reprinted with small corrections to the text and the bibliography. The overall content and pagination of the new printing remains the same; the difference comes in the form of corrections to typographical errors, editing of incomplete and missing references, and some updated spatio-temporal interpretations. From understanding environmental processes and climate trends to developing new technologies for mapping public-health data and the spread of invasive-species, there is a high demand for statistical analyses of data that take spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal information into account. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data presents a systematic approach to key quantitative techniques that incorporate the latest advances in statistical computing as well as hierarchical, particularly Bayesian, statistical modeling, with an emphasis on dynamical spatio-temporal models. Cressie and Wikle supply a unique presentation that incorporates ideas from the areas of time series and spatial statistics as well as stochastic processes. Beginning with separate treatments of temporal data and spatial data, the book combines these concepts to discuss spatio-temporal statistical methods for understanding complex processes. Topics of coverage include: Exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data, including visualization, spectral analysis, empirical orthogonal function analysis, and LISAs Spatio-temporal covariance functions, spatio-temporal kriging, and time series of spatial processes Development of hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal models (DSTMs), with discussion of linear and nonlinear DSTMs and computational algorithms for their implementation Quantifying and exploring spatio-temporal variability in scientific applications, including case studies based on real-world environmental data Throughout the book, interesting applications demonstrate the relevance of the presented concepts. Vivid, full-color graphics emphasize the visual nature of the topic, and a related FTP site contains supplementary material. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data is an excellent book for a graduate-level course on spatio-temporal statistics. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering, and the environmental and health sciences.",

    "category": "Mathematics",
    "description": "A visually intuitive approach to statistical data analysis Visual Statistics brings the most complex and advanced statisticalmethods within reach of those with little statistical training byusing animated graphics of the data. Using ViSta: The VisualStatistics System-developed by Forrest Young and Pedro Valero-Moraand available free of charge on the Internet-students can easilycreate fully interactive visualizations from relevant mathematicalstatistics, promoting perceptual and cognitive understanding of thedata's story. An emphasis is placed on a paradigm for understandingdata that is visual, intuitive, geometric, and active, rather thanone that relies on convoluted logic, heavy mathematics, systems ofalgebraic equations, or passive acceptance of results. A companion Web site complements the book by further demonstratingthe concept of creating interactive and dynamic graphics. The bookprovides users with the opportunity to view the graphics in adynamic way by illustrating how to analyze statistical data andexplore the concepts of visual statistics. Visual Statistics addresses and features the followingtopics: * Why use dynamic graphics? * A history of statistical graphics * Visual statistics and the graphical user interface * Visual statistics and the scientific method * Character-based statistical interface objects * Graphics-based statistical interfaces * Visualization for exploring univariate data This is an excellent textbook for undergraduate courses in dataanalysis and regression, for students majoring or minoring instatistics, mathematics, science, engineering, and computerscience, as well as for graduate-level courses in mathematics.

    "title": "Permutation Statistical Methods with R",
    "category": "Mathematics",
    "description": "This book takes a unique approach to explaining permutation statistics by integrating permutation statistical methods with a wide range of classical statistical methods and associated R programs. It opens by comparing and contrasting two models of statistical inference: the classical population model espoused by J. Neyman and E.S. Pearson and the permutation model first introduced by R.A. Fisher and E.J.G. Pitman. Numerous comparisons of permutation and classical statistical methods are presented, supplemented with a variety of R scripts for ease of computation. The text follows the general outline of an introductory textbook in statistics with chapters on central tendency and variability, one-sample tests, two-sample tests, matched-pairs tests, completely-randomized analysis of variance, randomized-blocks analysis of variance, simple linear regression and correlation, and the analysis of goodness of fit and contingency. Unlike classical statistical methods, permutation statistical methods do not rely on theoretical distributions, avoid the usual assumptions of normality and homogeneity, depend only on the observed data, and do not require random sampling. The methods are relatively new in that it took modern computing power to make them available to those working in mainstream research. Designed for an audience with a limited statistical background, the book can easily serve as a textbook for undergraduate or graduate courses in statistics, psychology, economics, political science or biology. No statistical training beyond a first course in statistics is required, but some knowledge of, or some interest in, the R programming language is assumed.",

    "description": "In this second book of what will be a four-volume series, the authors present, in a mathematically rigorous way, the essential foundations of both the theory and practice of algorithms, approximation, and optimization—essential topics in modern applied and computational mathematics. This material is the introductory framework upon which algorithm analysis, optimization, probability, statistics, machine learning, and control theory are built. This text gives a unified treatment of several topics that do not usually appear together: the theory and analysis of algorithms for mathematicians and data science students; probability and its applications; the theory and applications of approximation, including Fourier series, wavelets, and polynomial approximation; and the theory and practice of optimization, including dynamic optimization. When used in concert with the free supplemental lab materials, Foundations of Applied Mathematics, Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, Optimization teaches not only the theory but also the computational practice of modern mathematical methods. Exercises and examples build upon each other in a way that continually reinforces previous ideas, allowing students to retain learned concepts while achieving a greater depth. The mathematically rigorous lab content guides students to technical proficiency and answers the age-old question “When am I going to use this?” This textbook is geared toward advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics, data science, and machine learning.",

    "description": "The beauty of mathematics eludes all but a small, select handful of people. This monumental classic will illuminate the aesthetic delights of mathematics for all to behold. Why should only a tiny aristocracy hold the key to appreciating the elegance of mathematics? Why should intelligent, cultured people, who can easily articulate the brilliance of Shakespeare's imagery, quake at the prospect of deciphering a simple algebraic formula? Jerry King, a mathematics professor and a poet, razes the barriers between a world of two cultures and hands us the tools for appreciating the art and treasures of this elegant discipline. In his fluid, poetic voice, he initiates us into the splendid wonders of the Mathworld. He provides us with an original framework for contemplating mathematics as art. He deepens our ultimate comprehension of art by comparing the beauty of a Rembrandt as well as a Jackson Pollock with the riches to be mined in an elegant proof. Like the great philosophers of the past, Dr. King searches for pure Truth--a quest possible today only in the realm of mathematics. With his infectious enthusiasm, he explains with utmost clarity the intellectually stimulating underpinnings of both pure and applied mathematics. He goes on to decry how our educational system has failed by perfunctorily teaching us mathematics, depriving us of the pillars of beauty upon which mathematics rests. Never before has a book spoken so eloquently to our soul in instilling an appreciation for the grandeur of mathematics. Through Dr. King, the muses of mathematics will no longer sing for others and not for us. The elegant world of mathematics awaits us all to savor.",

This book describes the evolution of (algebraic) semigroup theory from its earliest origins to the establishment of a full-fledged theory. Semigroup theory might be termed `Cold War mathematics' because of the time during which it developed. There were thriving schools on both sides of the Iron Curtain, although the two sides were not always able to communicate with each other, or even gain access to the other's publications. A major theme of this book is the comparison of the approaches to the subject of mathematicians in East and West, and the study of the extent to which contact between the two sides was possible.",

    "description": "Foreword The modern developments in mathematical biology took place roughly between 1920 and 1940, a period now referred to as the \"Golden Age of Theoretical Biology\". The eminent Italian mathematician Vito Volterra played a decisive and widely acknowledged role in these developments. Volterra's interest in the application of mathematics to the non physical sciences, and to biology and economics in particular, dates back to the turn of the century and was expressed in his inaugural address at the University of Rome for the academic year 1900/01 (VOLTERRA 1901). Nevertheless, it was only in the mid-twenties that Volterra entered the field in person, at the instigation of his son in law, Umberto D'Ancona, who had confronted him with the problem of competition among animal species, asking him whether a mathematical treatment was possible. From that time on, until his death in 1940, Volterra produced a huge output of publications on the subject. Volterra's specific project was to transfer the model and the concepts of classical mechanics to biology, constructing a sort of \"rational mechanics\" and an \"analytic mechanics\" of biological associations. The new subject was thus to be equipped with a solid experimental or at least empirical basis, also in this case following the tried and tested example of mathematical physics. Although very few specific features of this reductionist programme have actually survived, Volterra's contribution was decisive, as is now universally acknowledged, in en couraging fresh studies in the field of mathematical biology.",
