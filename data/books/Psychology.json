    "description": "This volume presents a line of original experimental studies on the bodily self, investigating where people locate themselves in their bodies and how accurate they are at localizing their body parts. So far, it was not well known whether people locate themselves in one or more specific regions of their bodies. On the other hand, some systematic distortions in indicating bodily locations were already documented. In the present studies, participants were therefore asked to indicate their self-locations, as well as the locations of several of their body parts, using a self-directed, first-person perspective pointing paradigm in various virtual reality (VR) setups (different head-mounted displays and a large-screen immersive display). Overall, participants were found to locate themselves mainly in the (upper) face and the (upper) torso. However, striking differences in self-localization were found when testing in different VR setups. Upon further investigation, these differences were found to be foremost due to inaccuracies in body part localization. When taking these inaccuracies into account, differences between setups—and also with self-localization outside of VR—largely disappear. Another striking finding was that providing participants—in between pointing phases—with information about their bodies in the form of a real-time animated self-avatar, did not make them more accurate at locating their own body parts. While manipulating their viewpoint to chest-height of their self-avatar did shift the afterwards indicated locations of their own body parts upwards, towards where they were seen on the avatar. Potential explanations for the various new findings, also from tasks outside of VR, are discussed. Taken together, this volume suggests a differential involvement of multi-sensory information processing in experienced self-location within the body and the ability to locate body parts. Self-localization seems to be less flexible, possibly because it is strongly grounded in the 'bodily senses', while body part localization appears more adaptable to the manipulation of sensory stimuli, at least in the visual modality.",

    "title": "Where are you? Self- and body part localization using virtual reality setups",
    "category": "Psychology",
    "description": "This volume presents a line of original experimental studies on the bodily self, investigating where people locate themselves in their bodies and how accurate they are at localizing their body parts. So far, it was not well known whether people locate themselves in one or more specific regions of their bodies. On the other hand, some systematic distortions in indicating bodily locations were already documented. In the present studies, participants were therefore asked to indicate their self-locations, as well as the locations of several of their body parts, using a self-directed, first-person perspective pointing paradigm in various virtual reality (VR) setups (different head-mounted displays and a large-screen immersive display). Overall, participants were found to locate themselves mainly in the (upper) face and the (upper) torso. However, striking differences in self-localization were found when testing in different VR setups. Upon further investigation, these differences were found to be foremost due to inaccuracies in body part localization. When taking these inaccuracies into account, differences between setups—and also with self-localization outside of VR—largely disappear. Another striking finding was that providing participants—in between pointing phases—with information about their bodies in the form of a real-time animated self-avatar, did not make them more accurate at locating their own body parts. While manipulating their viewpoint to chest-height of their self-avatar did shift the afterwards indicated locations of their own body parts upwards, towards where they were seen on the avatar. Potential explanations for the various new findings, also from tasks outside of VR, are discussed. Taken together, this volume suggests a differential involvement of multi-sensory information processing in experienced self-location within the body and the ability to locate body parts. Self-localization seems to be less flexible, possibly because it is strongly grounded in the 'bodily senses', while body part localization appears more adaptable to the manipulation of sensory stimuli, at least in the visual modality.",

    "description": "This handbook is the first to bring together the latest theory and research on critical approaches to social psychological challenges. Edited by a leading authority in the field, this volume further establishes critical social psychology as a discipline of study, distinct from mainstream social psychology. The handbook explains how critical approaches to social processes and phenomena are essential to fully understanding them, and covers the main research topics in basic and applied social psychology, including social cognition, identity and social relations, alongside overviews of the main theories and methodologies that underpin critical approaches. This volume features a range of leading authors working on key social psychological issues, and highlights a commitment to a social psychology which shuns psychologisation, reductionism and neutrality. It provides invaluable insight into many of the most pressing and distressing issues we face in modern society, including the migrant and refugee crises affecting Europe; the devaluing of black lives in the USA; and the poverty, ill-health, and poor mental well-being that has resulted from ever-increasing austerity efforts in the UK. Including sections on critical perspectives, critical methodologies, and critical applications, this volume also focuses on issues within social cognition, self and identity. This one-stop handbook is an indispensable resource for a range of academics, students and researchers in the fields of psychology and sociology, and particularly those with an interest in social identity, power relations, and critical interventions.",

In examining the over-simplifications that have become dominant in modern psychology, the author points to such factors as competition with other explainers and pressure to offer and promulgate a unique explanation. The explainer is characterized as equating theory with simple, fixed categories, and as defending those categories as one would defend a personal territory, fending off competing explainers through mis-use of statistical devices.

    "title": "Specialty Competencies in Group Psychology",
    "category": "Psychology",
    "description": "Human beings are born into groups, educated in groups, and belong to many groups, yet routinely attribute individual motives to their actions when in fact group-influenced behaviors are the more likely culprit. The theory, research, and practice of group dynamics, group psychology, and group psychotherapy illuminate useful ways for us to learn group skills and to better understand how we are influenced by groups. In Specialty Competencies in Group Psychology Sally Barlow provides a comprehensive overview of the foundational and functional competencies related to the field of group psychology. Barlow describes the potential treatment benefits of group work and shows how the wide range of applicability makes this a relevant volume across diverse areas, regardless of the population receiving treatment or the theoretic orientation of the therapist. This volume distills the uniqueness and contributions of the specialty in a way that benefits not only psychologists who specialize in group psychotherapy, but also clinicians who have previously taken a more traditionally individual approach to treatment. Series in Specialty Competencies in Professional Psychology Series Editors Arthur M. Nezu and Christine Maguth Nezu As the field of psychology continues to grow and new specialty areas emerge and achieve recognition, it has become increasingly important to define the standards of professional specialty practice. Developed and conceived in response to this need for practical guidelines, this series presents methods, strategies, and techniques for conducting day-to-day practice in any given psychology specialty. The topical volumes address best practices across the functional and foundational competencies that characterize the various psychology specialties, including clinical psychology, cognitive and behavioral psychology, school psychology, geropsychology, forensic psychology, clinical neuropsychology, couples and family psychology, and more. Functional competencies include common practice activities like assessment and intervention, while foundational competencies represent core knowledge areas such as ethical and legal issues, cultural diversity, and professional identification. In addition to describing these competencies, each volume provides a definition, description, and development timeline of a particular specialty, including its essential and characteristic pattern of activities, as well as its distinctive and unique features. Written by recognized experts in their respective fields, volumes are comprehensive, up-to-date, and accessible. These volumes offer invaluable guidance to not only practicing mental health professionals, but those training for specialty practice as well.",

Including sections on critical perspectives, critical methodologies, and critical applications, this volume also focuses on issues within social cognition, self and identity. This one-stop handbook is an indispensable resource for a range of academics, students and researchers in the fields of psychology and sociology, and particularly those with an interest in social identity, power relations, and critical interventions.",

    "title": "Zero-Variable Theories and the Psychology of the Explainer",
    "category": "Psychology",
    "description": "In Zero-Variable Theories, Dr. Robert Wicklund invites the reader to consider the psychological perspective of the \"explainer\". In examining the over-simplifications that have become dominant in modern psychology, the author points to such factors as competition with other explainers and pressure to offer and promulgate a unique explanation. The explainer is characterized as equating theory with simple, fixed categories, and as defending those categories as one would defend a personal territory, fending off competing explainers through mis-use of statistical devices. The end result is the formulation of theories that neglect the perspectives of those whose behaviors are to be explained, and which simultaneously exclude psychological variables.",

    "title": "Specialty Competencies in Group Psychology",
    "category": "Psychology",
    "description": "Human beings are born into groups, educated in groups, and belong to many groups, yet routinely attribute individual motives to their actions when in fact group-influenced behaviors are the more likely culprit. The theory, research, and practice of group dynamics, group psychology, and group psychotherapy illuminate useful ways for us to learn group skills and to better understand how we are influenced by groups. In Specialty Competencies in Group Psychology Sally Barlow provides a comprehensive overview of the foundational and functional competencies related to the field of group psychology. Barlow describes the potential treatment benefits of group work and shows how the wide range of applicability makes this a relevant volume across diverse areas, regardless of the population receiving treatment or the theoretic orientation of the therapist. This volume distills the uniqueness and contributions of the specialty in a way that benefits not only psychologists who specialize in group psychotherapy, but also clinicians who have previously taken a more traditionally individual approach to treatment. Series in Specialty Competencies in Professional Psychology Series Editors Arthur M. Nezu and Christine Maguth Nezu As the field of psychology continues to grow and new specialty areas emerge and achieve recognition, it has become increasingly important to define the standards of professional specialty practice. Developed and conceived in response to this need for practical guidelines, this series presents methods, strategies, and techniques for conducting day-to-day practice in any given psychology specialty. The topical volumes address best practices across the functional and foundational competencies that characterize the various psychology specialties, including clinical psychology, cognitive and behavioral psychology, school psychology, geropsychology, forensic psychology, clinical neuropsychology, couples and family psychology, and more. Functional competencies include common practice activities like assessment and intervention, while foundational competencies represent core knowledge areas such as ethical and legal issues, cultural diversity, and professional identification. In addition to describing these competencies, each volume provides a definition, description, and development timeline of a particular specialty, including its essential and characteristic pattern of activities, as well as its distinctive and unique features. Written by recognized experts in their respective fields, volumes are comprehensive, up-to-date, and accessible. These volumes offer invaluable guidance to not only practicing mental health professionals, but those training for specialty practice as well.",
