    "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

    "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.",

    "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts.

    "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

    "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

If you want a comprehensive journey into one of the most important JavaScript frameworks around today, dive into this course. What You Will Learn Take control of the front end with reactive JavaScript programming Discover what ReactJS offers your development - before mastering it Create React elements with properties and children Use JSX to speed up your React development process Test your React components with the Jest test framework Learn the latest syntax of ES6 Execute ES6 in a non-supported ES6 environment Learn the principles of object-oriented programming Create a complete single-page application Use an application design plan to write smarter, more meaningful code Learn how to use animations to give extra style to your application Get to grips with the React Native environment Write your own custom native UI components Integrate native modules in Objective-C and Java that interact with JavaScript In Detail ReactJS has helped to transform the web as we know it. Designed by Facebook to help developers build rapid, responsive UI that can deal with data-intensive usage, it's an essential component in any web developer's skillset. This ReactJS course, in five connected modules, provides you with a fast, engaging and practical route into ReactJS—so you can build powerful, elegant, and modern web applications. Beginning with the Reactive Programming with JavaScript module, you will learn how to take advantage of a reactive and functional programming paradigm to rethink how you approach your JavaScript code. It's built to help you understand the concepts, relevant and applicable for any frontend developer. You'll then dive a little deeper into ReactJS. The second module gives you a rapid look through the fundamentals of ReactJS, showing you how to build a basic application and demonstrating how to implement the Flux architecture. In the third module you will get to grips with ES6—this will make you a more fluent JavaScript developer, giving you control over ReactJS. You can put your old JavaScript hacks aside and instead explore how to create ES6 custom iterators. In the final two modules you'll learn how to fully master ReactJS, exploring its wider ecosystem of tools that have helped to make it one of the most important tools in web development today. Ending with insights and guidance on React Native, the tool built for today's demand for native, intuitive user experiences and interfaces, with this course you can be confident in building dynamic and modern apps with React. Style and approach Consisting of five separate modules, journey from the fundamentals of reactive programming to the exciting possibilities of React Native. Each module builds on each other, helping you to incrementally develop your skills and knowledge.",

They enable you to write components in a more intuitive way without using classes, which makes your code easier to read and maintain. Building on from the previous edition, this book is updated with React Hooks and the latest changes introduced in create-react-app and Spring Boot 2.1. This book starts with a brief introduction to Spring Boot. You’ll understand how to use dependency injection and work with the data access layer of Spring using Hibernate as the ORM tool. You’ll then learn how to build your own RESTful API endpoints for web applications. As you advance, the book introduces you to other Spring components, such as Spring Security to help you secure the backend. Moving on, you’ll explore React and its app development environment and components for building your frontend. Finally, you’ll create a Docker container for your application by implementing the best practices that underpin professional full stack web development.

You can pick up and read this book and build an industry-standard system in a weekend: It has everything you need to get started with a new project. I also found it helpful in reviewing the structure of existing projects.” —Timothy Pratley, developer Developers are discovering the exceptional power of Clojure’s functional programming model to quickly solve problems in domains ranging from social networking to Big Data. Clojure is fast and efficient—ideal for rapid prototyping and lean development. And it is highly expressive and extremely extensible, which makes Clojure one of today’s leading tools for software innovation. Since it targets the Java Virtual Machine, Clojure also leverages the Java platform’s maturity and enormous ecosystem. Clojure Recipes is a wide-ranging, up-to-date “code recipe book” for this increasingly popular language. With practical and self-contained examples, author Julian Gamble illuminates Clojure’s key features and best practices, showing how to solve real-world problems one step at a time. Focusing on Clojure 1.7 and higher, Gamble fully reflects recent enhancements that ensure you’re getting the most up-to-date code for your project. Gamble first walks you through the essential steps required to set up your Clojure development environment, from setting up the Leiningen build tool to packaging Clojure for Java EE environments. He then shows you how to build both basic and advanced REST servers, before turning to a wide range of increasingly sophisticated applications. In this book you will find Innovative Clojure code for diverse web, security, administration, and development tasks, from log reading and app monitoring to software testing Detailed instructions for using concurrency primitives, writing new DSLs, simplifying cloud database development, and more “Learn by doing” projects, which offer practical experience with Clojurescript, Storm, Pedestal, Datomic, and other advanced tools Coverage of using Clojure with Cascalog 2.0 to write complex Hadoop queries with minimal code The breadth and quality of Gamble’s examples make Clojure Recipes uniquely valuable both to developers who are exploring Clojure for the first time and to those already using it in production.",

    "description": "“There’s something for everyone here. . . . You can pick up and read this book and build an industry-standard system in a weekend: It has everything you need to get started with a new project. I also found it helpful in reviewing the structure of existing projects.” —Timothy Pratley, developer Developers are discovering the exceptional power of Clojure’s functional programming model to quickly solve problems in domains ranging from social networking to Big Data. Clojure is fast and efficient—ideal for rapid prototyping and lean development. And it is highly expressive and extremely extensible, which makes Clojure one of today’s leading tools for software innovation. Since it targets the Java Virtual Machine, Clojure also leverages the Java platform’s maturity and enormous ecosystem. Clojure Recipes is a wide-ranging, up-to-date “code recipe book” for this increasingly popular language. With practical and self-contained examples, author Julian Gamble illuminates Clojure’s key features and best practices, showing how to solve real-world problems one step at a time. Focusing on Clojure 1.7 and higher, Gamble fully reflects recent enhancements that ensure you’re getting the most up-to-date code for your project. Gamble first walks you through the essential steps required to set up your Clojure development environment, from setting up the Leiningen build tool to packaging Clojure for Java EE environments.

    "description": "“There’s something for everyone here. . . . You can pick up and read this book and build an industry-standard system in a weekend: It has everything you need to get started with a new project. I also found it helpful in reviewing the structure of existing projects.” —Timothy Pratley, developer Developers are discovering the exceptional power of Clojure’s functional programming model to quickly solve problems in domains ranging from social networking to Big Data. Clojure is fast and efficient—ideal for rapid prototyping and lean development. And it is highly expressive and extremely extensible, which makes Clojure one of today’s leading tools for software innovation. Since it targets the Java Virtual Machine, Clojure also leverages the Java platform’s maturity and enormous ecosystem. Clojure Recipes is a wide-ranging, up-to-date “code recipe book” for this increasingly popular language. With practical and self-contained examples, author Julian Gamble illuminates Clojure’s key features and best practices, showing how to solve real-world problems one step at a time. Focusing on Clojure 1.7 and higher, Gamble fully reflects recent enhancements that ensure you’re getting the most up-to-date code for your project.

You'll learn how to develop a complete Node.js web app, with a backend database tier to help you explore several databases. You'll deploy the app to real web servers, including a cloud hosting platform built on AWS EC2 using Terraform and Docker Swarm, while integrating other tools such as Redis and NGINX. As you advance, you'll learn about unit and functional testing, along with deploying test infrastructure using Docker. Finally, you'll discover how to harden Node.js app security, use Let's Encrypt to provision the HTTPS service, and implement several forms of app security with the help of expert practices. With each chapter, the book will help you put your knowledge into practice throughout the entire life cycle of developing a web app. By the end of this Node.js book, you'll have gained practical Node.js web development knowledge and be able to build and deploy your own apps on a public web hosting solution.

Node.js, with its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, is exactly the right choice for building RESTful APIs. This third edition of RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 10 will teach you to create scalable and rich RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform. You will be introduced to the latest NPM package handler and understand how to use it to customize your RESTful development process. You will begin by understanding the key principle that makes an HTTP application a RESTful-enabled application. After writing a simple HTTP request handler, you will create and test Node.js modules using automated tests and mock objects; explore using the NoSQL database, MongoDB, to store data; and get to grips with using self-descriptive URLs. You’ll learn to set accurate HTTP status codes along with understanding how to keep your applications backward-compatible. Also, while implementing a full-fledged RESTful service, you will use Swagger to document the API and implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint with Mocha. Lastly, you will explore some authentication techniques to secure your application. What you will learn Install, develop, and test your own Node.js user modules Understand the differences between HTTP and RESTful applications Use self-descriptive URLs and set accurate HTTP status codes Eliminate third-party dependencies in your tests with mocking Implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint with Mocha Secure your services with NoSQL database integration within Node.js applications Integrate a simple frontend using JavaScript libraries available on a CDN server Who this book is for If you are a web developer keen to enrich your development skills to create server-side RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform, this book is for you.

Node.js, with its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, is exactly the right choice for building RESTful APIs. This third edition of RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 10 will teach you to create scalable and rich RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform. You will be introduced to the latest NPM package handler and understand how to use it to customize your RESTful development process. You will begin by understanding the key principle that makes an HTTP application a RESTful-enabled application. After writing a simple HTTP request handler, you will create and test Node.js modules using automated tests and mock objects; explore using the NoSQL database, MongoDB, to store data; and get to grips with using self-descriptive URLs. You’ll learn to set accurate HTTP status codes along with understanding how to keep your applications backward-compatible. Also, while implementing a full-fledged RESTful service, you will use Swagger to document the API and implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint with Mocha. Lastly, you will explore some authentication techniques to secure your application. What you will learn Install, develop, and test your own Node.js user modules Understand the differences between HTTP and RESTful applications Use self-descriptive URLs and set accurate HTTP status codes Eliminate third-party dependencies in your tests with mocking Implement automation tests for a REST-enabled endpoint with Mocha Secure your services with NoSQL database integration within Node.js applications Integrate a simple frontend using JavaScript libraries available on a CDN server Who this book is for If you are a web developer keen to enrich your development skills to create server-side RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform, this book is for you.

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",

Earlier, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting, but Node.js supports the creation of dynamic Web applications by using JavaScript for server-side scripting. Node.js has taken the world by a storm by simplifying Web application development thorough the use of readily available and pluggable modules, thus, reducing the overall development time. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, you can learn to design and develop attractive and efficient Web applications using Node.js.This book intends to familiarize the reader with the basic and advanced concepts of Node.js. The book begins with an introduction to the features and tools of Node.js and proceeds to explain the use of different modules in Node.js. It explains the concepts in a detailed but simple format along with codes and detailed steps of demonstrations. You will learn to implement different modules and manipulate databases with Node.js. The book concludes with an explanation of Express module which is a minimalist Web framework for Node.js.Node.js is an evolving technology and gets upgraded regularly. Thereby, covering all updates is beyond the scope of this book. The book also assumes that the reader has basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML technologies. It serves as a guide for beginners as well as experienced developers aspiring to begin development using Node.js. It has been written after extensive research and reference from different Node.js sites, blogs, books, articles, discussion forums, etc. Any shortcomings of the books are purely due to commercial and scope constraints.",
