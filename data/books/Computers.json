    "description": "If the intelligence of artificial systems were to surpass that of humans, humanity would face significant risks. The time has come to consider these issues, and this consideration must include progress in artificial intelligence (AI) as much as insights from AI theory. Featuring contributions from leading experts and thinkers in artificial intelligence, Risks of Artificial Intelligence is the first volume of collected chapters dedicated to examining the risks of AI. The book evaluates predictions of the future of AI, proposes ways to ensure that AI systems will be beneficial to humans, and then critically evaluates such proposals. The book covers the latest research on the risks and future impacts of AI. It starts with an introduction to the problem of risk and the future of artificial intelligence, followed by a discussion (Armstrong/Sokala/ÓhÉigeartaigh) on how predictions of its future have fared to date. Omohundro makes the point that even an innocuous artificial agent can easily turn into a serious threat for humans. T. Goertzel explains how to succeed in the design of artificial agents. But will these be a threat for humanity, or a useful tool? Ways to assure beneficial outcomes through ‘machine ethics’ and ‘utility functions’ are discussed by Brundage and Yampolskiy. B. Goertzel and Potapov/Rodionov propose ‘learning’ and ‘empathy’ as paths towards safer AI while Kornai explains how the impact of AI may be bounded. Sandberg explains the implications of human-like AI via the technique of brain emulation. Dewey discusses strategies to deal with the ‘fast takeoff’ of artificial intelligence and, finally, Bishop explains why there is no need to worry because computers will remain in a state of ‘artificial stupidity’. Sharing insights from leading thinkers in artificial intelligence, this book provides you with an expert-level perspective of what is on the horizon for AI, whether it will be a threat for humanity, and how we might counteract this threat.",

    "description": "Although many texts exist offering an introduction to artificial intelligence (AI), this book is unique in that it places an emphasis on knowledge representation (KR) concepts. It includes small-scale implementations in PROLOG to illustrate the major KR paradigms and their developments.****back cover copy:**Knowledge representation is at the heart of the artificial intelligence enterprise: anyone writing a program which seeks to work by encoding and manipulating knowledge needs to pay attention to the scheme whereby he will represent the knowledge, and to be aware of the consequences of the choices made.****The book's distinctive approach introduces the topic of AI through a study of knowledge representation issues. It assumes a basic knowledge of computing and a familiarity with the principles of elementary formal logic would be advantageous.****Knowledge Representation: An Approach to Artificial Intelligence develops from an introductory consideration of AI, knowledge representation and logic, through search technique to the three central knowledge paradigms: production rules, structured objects, and predicate calculus. The final section of the book illustrates the application of these knowledge representation paradigms through the Prolog Programming language and with an examination of diverse expert systems applications. The book concludes with a look at some advanced issues in knowledge representation.****This text provides an introduction to AI through a study of knowledge representation and each chapter contains exercises for students. Experienced computer scientists and students alike, seeking an introduction to AI and knowledge representations will find this an invaluable text.",

    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Mathematics plays a key role in computer science, some researchers would consider computers as nothing but the physical embodiment of mathematical systems. And whether you are designing a digital circuit, a computer program or a new programming language, you need mathematics to be able to reason about the design -- its correctness, robustness and dependability. This book covers the foundational mathematics necessary for courses in computer science. The common approach to presenting mathematical concepts and operators is to define them in terms of properties they satisfy, and then based on these definitions develop ways of computing the result of applying the operators and prove them correct. This book is mainly written for computer science students, so here the author takes a different approach: he starts by defining ways of calculating the results of applying the operators and then proves that they satisfy various properties. After justifying his underlying approach the author offers detailed chapters covering propositional logic, predicate calculus, sets, relations, discrete structures, structured types, numbers, and reasoning about programs. The book contains chapter and section summaries, detailed proofs and many end-of-section exercises -- key to the learning process. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, and although the treatment focuses on areas with frequent applications in computer science, the book is also suitable for students of mathematics and engineering.",

    "description": "Named a Notable Book in the 21st Annual Best of Computing list by the ACM! Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne’s Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach is the ideal modern introduction to computer science with Java programming for both students and professionals. Taking a broad, applications-based approach, Sedgewick and Wayne teach through important examples from science, mathematics, engineering, finance, and commercial computing. The book demystifies computation, explains its intellectual underpinnings, and covers the essential elements of programming and computational problem solving in today’s environments. The authors begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, they turn to functions, introducing key modular programming concepts, including components and reuse. They present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming, covering current programming paradigms and approaches to data abstraction. Building on this foundation, Sedgewick and Wayne widen their focus to the broader discipline of computer science. They introduce classical sorting and searching algorithms, fundamental data structures and their application, and scientific techniques for assessing an implementation’s performance. Using abstract models, readers learn to answer basic questions about computation, gaining insight for practical application. Finally, the authors show how machine architecture links the theory of computing to real computers, and to the field’s history and evolution. For each concept, the authors present all the information readers need to build confidence, together with examples that solve intriguing problems. Each chapter contains question-and-answer sections, self-study drills, and challenging problems that demand creative solutions. Companion web site (introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java) contains Extensive supplementary information, including suggested approaches to programming assignments, checklists, and FAQs Graphics and sound libraries Links to program code and test data Solutions to selected exercises Chapter summaries Detailed instructions for installing a Java programming environment Detailed problem sets and projects Companion 20-part series of video lectures is available at informit.com/title/9780134493831",

    "title": "Logics for Computer Science",
    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Providing an in-depth introduction to fundamental classical and non-classical logics, this textbook offers a comprehensive survey of logics for computer scientists. Logics for Computer Science contains intuitive introductory chapters explaining the need for logical investigations, motivations for different types of logics and some of their history. They are followed by strict formal approach chapters. All chapters contain many detailed examples explaining each of the introduced notions and definitions, well chosen sets of exercises with carefully written solutions, and sets of homework. While many logic books are available, they were written by logicians for logicians, not for computer scientists. They usually choose one particular way of presenting the material and use a specialized language. Logics for Computer Science discusses Gentzen as well as Hilbert formalizations, first order theories, the Hilbert Program, Godel's first and second incompleteness theorems and their proofs. It also introduces and discusses some many valued logics, modal logics and introduces algebraic models for classical, intuitionistic, and modal S4 and S5 logics. The theory of computation is based on concepts defined by logicians and mathematicians. Logic plays a fundamental role in computer science, and this book explains the basic theorems, as well as different techniques of proving them in classical and some non-classical logics. Important applications derived from concepts of logic for computer technology include Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. In addition to Computer Science, this book may also find an audience in mathematics and philosophy courses, and some of the chapters are also useful for a course in Artificial Intelligence.",

    "description": "Analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), what are they good for? The bandwagon keeps answering, absolutely everything! Analytics and artificial intelligence have captured the attention of everyone from top executives to the person in the street. While these disciplines have a relatively long history, within the last ten or so years they have exploded into corporate business and public consciousness. Organizations have rushed to embrace data-driven decision making. Companies everywhere are turning out products boasting that \"artificial intelligence is included.\" We are indeed living in exciting times. The question we need to ask is, do we really know how to get business value from these exciting tools? Unfortunately, both the analytics and AI communities have not done a great job in collaborating and communicating with each other to build the necessary synergies. This book bridges the gap between these two critical fields. The book begins by explaining the commonalities and differences in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and autonomy by giving a historical perspective for each of these fields, followed by exploration of common technologies and current trends in each field.

    "description": "This book offers an overview of state-of-the-art econometric techniques, with a special emphasis on financial econometrics. There is a major need for such techniques, since the traditional way of designing mathematical models – based on researchers’ insights – can no longer keep pace with the ever-increasing data flow. To catch up, many application areas have begun relying on data science, i.e., on techniques for extracting models from data, such as data mining, machine learning, and innovative statistics. In terms of capitalizing on data science, many application areas are way ahead of economics. To close this gap, the book provides examples of how data science techniques can be used in economics. Corresponding techniques range from almost traditional statistics to promising novel ideas such as quantum econometrics. Given its scope, the book will appeal to students and researchers interested in state-of-the-art developments, and to practitioners interested in using data science techniques.",

The widespread deployment of “Black box” algorithms that are difficult or impossible to understand and explain, even for their developers, is a primary source of these unanticipated harms, making modern techniques and methods for manipulating large data sets seem sinister, even dangerous. When put in the hands of authoritarian governments, these algorithms have enabled suppression of political dissent and persecution of minorities. To prevent these harms, data scientists everywhere must come to understand how the algorithms that they build and deploy may harm certain groups or be unfair. Responsible Data Science delivers a comprehensive, practical treatment of how to implement data science solutions in an even-handed and ethical manner that minimizes the risk of undue harm to vulnerable members of society. Both data science practitioners and managers of analytics teams will learn how to: Improve model transparency, even for black box models Diagnose bias and unfairness within models using multiple metrics Audit projects to ensure fairness and minimize the possibility of unintended harm Perfect for data science practitioners, Responsible Data Science will also earn a spot on the bookshelves of technically inclined managers, software developers, and statisticians.",

    "description": "Social network analysis applications have experienced tremendous advances within the last few years due in part to increasing trends towards users interacting with each other on the internet. Social networks are organized as graphs, and the data on social networks takes on the form of massive streams, which are mined for a variety of purposes. Social Network Data Analytics covers an important niche in the social network analytics field. This edited volume, contributed by prominent researchers in this field, presents a wide selection of topics on social network data mining such as Structural Properties of Social Networks, Algorithms for Structural Discovery of Social Networks and Content Analysis in Social Networks. This book is also unique in focussing on the data analytical aspects of social networks in the internet scenario, rather than the traditional sociology-driven emphasis prevalent in the existing books, which do not focus on the unique data-intensive characteristics of online social networks. Emphasis is placed on simplifying the content so that students and practitioners benefit from this book. This book targets advanced level students and researchers concentrating on computer science as a secondary text or reference book. Data mining, database, information security, electronic commerce and machine learning professionals will find this book a valuable asset, as well as primary associations such as ACM, IEEE and Management Science.",

It is written from a general management perspective, and it draws on observations at 12 companies whose annual revenues range between $500 million and $20 billion. Over the past 15 years, my company has formulated vendor-neutral business-focused BI strategies and program execution plans in collaboration with manufacturers, distributors, retailers, logistics companies, insurers, investment companies, credit unions, and utilities, among others. It is through these experiences that we have validated business-driven BI strategy formulation methods and identified common enterprise BI program execution challenges. In recent years, terms like “big data” and “big data analytics” have been introduced into the business and technical lexicon. Upon close examination, the newer terminology is about the same thing that BI has always been about: analyzing the vast amounts of data that companies generate and/or purchase in the course of business as a means of improving profitability and competitiveness. Accordingly, we will use the terms BI and business intelligence throughout the book, and we will discuss the newer concepts like big data as appropriate. More broadly, the goal of this book is to share methods and observations that will help companies achieve BI success and thereby increase revenues, reduce costs, or both. Provides ideas for improving the business performance of one’s company or business functions Emphasizes proven, practical, step-by-step methods that readers can readily apply in their companies Includes exercises and case studies with road-tested advice about formulating BI strategies and program plans",

Logically it moves on to actual stories in data-statistical ones with trends and human stories. the technical part comes up quickly with how to gather, parse and format data with Python, R, Excel, Google docs, etc and details tools to visualize data-native graphics for the Web like ActionScript, Flash libraries, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML. Every chapter provides an example as well. Patterns over time and kinds of data charts are followed by proportions, chart types and examples. Next, examples and descriptions of outliers and how to show them, different kinds of maps, how to guide your readers and explain the data \"in the visualization\". The book ends with a value-add appendix on graphical perception. Data Points focuses on the approach to visualization and data. Visualization is a medium that can be used as a tool, art, a way to tell stories, etc., Data Points guides readers through making data approachable through visualization techniques and best practices. The focus is on designing with a purpose in mind. Data Points discusses why recipes (from the rules) work and expands on how readers can make their own recipes. The book is example-driven, featuring work from people in areas of art, design, business, statistics, computer science, cartography, and online media, as well as many of the author's own illustrations. The major sections of the book cover: Visualization as Medium -- In the same way not all movies are documentaries, not all visualization is about optimal visual perception. Data Representation -- There are rules across all visualization applications, such as the use of appropriate shapes to accurately represent values. Design with Purpose -- Rules can be broken though. It all depends on who and what you're designing for.

Who This Book Is For Web developers and data science professionals who want to make their visualizations work for smaller screen sizes. Some basic knowledge of JavaScript and Data visualization is expected. What You Will Learn Get familiar with responsive design for data visualizations Understand the main concepts of D3.js to create interactive visualizations Unleash the power of Bootstrap to create stunning and responsive visualizations for all screen resolutions Implement Touch and Mouse interactions for mobile-first applications Design Transitions and Animations that impress in portrait and landscape Build a Responsive World Map using GeoJSON and D3.js In Detail Using D3.js and Responsive Design principles, you will not just be able to implement visualizations that look and feel awesome across all devices and screen resolutions, but you will also boost your productivity and reduce development time by making use of Bootstrap—the most popular framework for developing responsive web applications. This book teaches the basics of scalable vector graphics (SVG), D3.js, and Bootstrap while focusing on Responsive Design as well as mobile-first visualizations; the reader will start by discovering Bootstrap and how it can be used for creating responsive applications, and then implement a basic bar chart in D3.js. You will learn about loading, parsing, and filtering data in JavaScript and then dive into creating a responsive visualization by using Media Queries, responsive interactions for Mobile and Desktop devices, and transitions to bring the visualization to life. In the following chapters, we build a fully responsive interactive map to display geographic data using GeoJSON and set up integration testing with Protractor to test the application across real devices using a mobile API gateway such as AWS Device Farm. You will finish the journey by discovering the caveats of mobile-first applications and learn how to master cross-browser complications. Style and approach As the world shifts to mobile devices for consuming data on the Web, developers are faced with the unique challenge of making data visualizations work for their smaller screens. The growth of responsive web design enabled developers to adopt page layouts and media for smaller screens, but there is still little information available on how to adapt data visualizations for the smaller screens. This book fills this important gap and shows how responsive web design principles can be extended to create visualizations that work well regardless of the screen size, thereby allowing developers to build user-friendly visualizations that work well on all devices. In addition to covering some of the popular techniques and design patterns for building responsive visualizations, the book also shows readers how to implement these techniques with the help of some popular tools and libraries.",

    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "This book covers both classical and modern models in deep learning. The primary focus is on the theory and algorithms of deep learning. The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching. Where possible, an application-centric view is highlighted in order to provide an understanding of the practical uses of each class of techniques.",

    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics. The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area. The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas. The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming. - Covers the whole field of constraint programming - Survey-style chapters - Five chapters on applications",

Specifications express information about a program that is not normally part of the program, and often cannot be expressed in a programming lan guage. In the past, the word \"specification\" has sometimes been used to refer to somewhat vague documentation written in English. But today it indicates a precise statement, written in a machine processable language, about the purpose and behavior of a program. Specifications are written in languages that are just as precise as programming languages, but have additional capabilities that increase their power of expression. The termi nology formal specification is sometimes used to emphasize the modern meaning. For us, all specifications are formal. The use of specifications as an integral part of a program opens up a whole new area of programming - progmmming with specifications. This book describes how to use specifications in the process of building programs, debugging them, and interfacing them with other programs. It deals with a new trend in programming - the evolution of specification languages from the current generation of programming languages. And it describes new strategies and styles of programming that utilize specifications.

The aims of this part are twofold: to provide the beginner with an overview of the terminology and concepts of computer graphics, based on GKS, and to give the computer graphics expert an introduc tion to the GKS standard. In the early chapters of this part, the main areas of computer graphics, the various classes of com puter graphics users, the interfaces of GKS and its underlying design concepts are discussed and important terms are defined. The later chapters give an informal introduction to the main concepts of GKS and their interrelationships: output, attributes, coordinate systems, transformations, input, segments, metafile, state lists, and error handling. This introduction to the GKS framework will prepare the ground for the detailed description of 2D GKS functions in Part III and the 3D extensions to GKS in Part IV. 1 WHAT IS COMPUTER GRAPHICS? 1. 1 Defmition of Computer Graphics The Data Processing Vocabulary of the International Organization for Stan dardization (ISO) [ISO 84] defines Computer Graphics as follows: \"Methods and techniques for converting data to and from a graphic display via computer. \" This definition refers to three basic components of any computer graphics system - namely \"data\", \"computer\", and \"display\".",

We will start by building a small introduction application and then proceed to the creation of a fully functional, dynamic responsive web application called ProFitOro. In this application, we will build a Pomodoro timer combined with office workouts. Besides the Pomodoro timer and ProFitOro workouts will enable authentication and collaborative content management. We will explore topics such as Vue reactive data binding, reusable components, routing, and Vuex store along with its state, actions, mutations, and getters. We will create Vue applications using both webpack and Nuxt.js templates while exploring cool hot Nuxt.js features such as code splitting and server-side rendering. We will use Jest to test this application, and we will even revive some trigonometry from our secondary school! While developing the app, you will go through the new grid system of Bootstrap 4 along with Vue.js' directives. We will connect Vuex store to the Firebase real-time database, data storage, and authentication APIs and use this data later inside the application's reactive components.

The changing way in which we access the web means that there has never been a greater range of screen sizes and associated user experiences to consider. With these recent trends driving changes in design, typical desktop-only websites fail to meet even minimum expectations when it comes to style and usability, which can be vital when your website is central to yours or your client's brand. Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3, Second Edition is an updated and improved guide that responds to the latest challenges and trends in web design, giving you access to the most effective approaches to modern responsive design. Learn how to build websites with a “responsive and mobile first” methodology, allowing a website to display effortlessly on every device that accesses it. Packed with examples, and a thorough explanation of modern techniques and syntax, Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3, Second Edition provides a comprehensive resource for all things 'responsive'. This updated new edition covers all the most up-to-date techniques and tools needed to build great responsive designs, ensuring that your projects won't just be built 'right' for today, but in the future too. Chapter example code is all hosted on rwd.education, a dedicated site for the book, built by the author, using the approaches and techniques championed throughout. Style and approach This book should be useful in two ways: as a 'read from the beginning and learn as you go' resource but also as a reference you can come back to in the months to come – when trying to remember this or that syntax or look up a link that may help you out of a development hell-hole. To this end, rather than follow a single design through from chapter one and build on it incrementally until the end of the book, each chapter exists in relative isolation. This means that code and examples are particular to each chapter and don't need to be considered along with what has gone before or after. That doesn't mean that each chapter's techniques won't work in unison; the reference site for this book, rwd.education is an example of them all working in harmony. However, by limiting the chapter examples to the topic at hand, it should be simpler for you to understand and reference the essence of each example and topic in the future.",

    "description": "Are you still designing web sites like it's 1999? If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards. Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design. Our popular reference, Web Design in a Nutshell, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels. The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics: Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values. Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM) Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, Web Design in a Nutshell, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology. There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.",

In Bulletproof Web Design, Third Edition, bestselling author and web designer Dan Cederholm outlines standards-based strategies for building designs that can accommodate the myriad ways users choose to view the content. Each chapter starts out with an example of an unbulletproof approach--one that employs traditional HTML-based techniques--which Dan deconstructs, pointing out its limitations. He then gives the example a makeover using HTML and CSS, so you can learn to replace bloated code with lean markup and CSS for fast-loading sites that are accessible to all users. Finally, he assembles all of the page components discussed in prior chapters into a single-page template. This fully revised and updated third edition introduces CSS3 and HTML5 methods and features redesigned case studies including new responsive design examples. Size text using keywords, percentages, and ems to allow more user control. Plan for vertical expansion of horizontal page components. Use floats to achieve grid-like results. Ensure that content is still readable in the absence of images or CSS. Strip the presentation from data tables, and rebuild with CSS. Progressively enhance your designs using HTML5 and CSS3.

    "category": "Computers",
    "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

    "description": "Learning a new programming language might seem like a challenging task. You may have looked at coding in the past and felt it was too confusing and big to tackle. Mastering C#: A Beginner’s Guide will take you, step by step, through the process of learning one of the best programming languages out there. In a matter of no time, you will be able to write code like a professional. C# is one of the most widely used programming languages available – and for a good reason. Developed by Microsoft, it has a simplified syntax, type safety, garbage collection, cross-language capabilities, and developer support. It offers high productivity of rapid application development languages with the dynamic power of C and C++. Updated to cover the new features of C#, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, Mastering C# takes the language to the next level by promoting the ability to cleanly run programs that don’t rely on static type definitions. In this book, concepts are broken down into simple steps to make sure that you can easily master the C# language, even if you have never tried coding. Carefully selected C# examples illustrate all concepts. In addition, the output for all examples are provided immediately, so you do not have to wait untilyou have access to your computer to test the examples. Topics are handpicked to give you proper exposure to C#, while not overwhelming with too much information. Mastering C# also covers the fundamentals of programming. It teaches you how to define and use variables, how to manage primitive data structures (such as numbers), how to organize logical statements, how to print on the console, how to apply arrays, work with numeral systems, how to set and use methods, and how to create objects. Along with the basic programming knowledge, Mastering C# will help you understand more complicated concepts, including string processing, exception handling, using complex data structures (like trees and hash tables), defining custom classes, and working with LINQ queries. The concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) – an established approach in modern software development – is covered in depth as well. Moreover, you will get a complete methodology for solving programming problems as well as algorithmic problems in general. This gives you the opportunity to become a master programmer who has in-depth knowledge of programming and technology. After you acquire the fundamentals of programming, it will become much easier for you to read and learn databases and web applications, and you will understand what you read of the new material much easier rather than if you directly begin learning SQL, ASP.NET, AJAX, XAML, or WinRT. All in all, Mastering C# is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#. This knowledge will enable you to turn your original and imaginative ideas into a real-world practical application.",

In this comprehensive guide to Ruby optimization, you'll learn how to write faster Ruby code--but that's just the beginning. See exactly what makes Ruby and Rails code slow, and how to fix it. Alex Dymo will guide you through perils of memory and CPU optimization, profiling, measuring, performance testing, garbage collection, and tuning. You'll find that all those \"hard\" things aren't so difficult after all, and your code will run orders of magnitude faster. This is the first book ever that consolidates all the Ruby performance optimization advice in one place. It's your comprehensive guide to memory optimization, CPU optimization, garbage collector tuning, profiling, measurements, performance testing, and more. You'll go from performance rookie to expert. First, you'll learn the best practices for writing Ruby code that's easy not only on the CPU, but also on memory, and that doesn't trigger the dreaded garbage collector. You'll find out that garbage collection accounts for 80% of slowdowns, and often takes more than 50% of your program's execution time. And you'll discover the bottlenecks in Rails code and learn how selective attribute loading and preloading can mitigate the performance costs of ActiveRecord. As you advance to Ruby performance expert, you'll learn how profile your code, how to make sense out of profiler reports, and how to make optimization decisions based on them. You'll make sure slow code doesn't creep back into your Ruby application by writing performance tests, and you'll learn the right way to benchmark Ruby. And finally, you'll dive into the Ruby interpreter internals to really understand why garbage collection makes Ruby so slow, and how you can tune it up. What You Need: Some version of Ruby. The advice from this book applies to all modern Ruby versions from 1.9 to 2.2. 80% of the material will also be useful for legacy Ruby 1.8 users, and there is 1.8-specific advice as well.",

    "description": "After years of using spacer GIFs, layers of nested tables, and other improvised solutions for building your web sites, getting used to the more stringent \"standards-compliant\" design that is de rigueur among professionals today can be intimidating. With standards-driven design, keeping style separate from content is not just a possibility but a reality. You no longer use HTML and XHTML as design tools, but strictly as ways to define the meaning and structure of web content. And Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to page layout. When you follow the standards, both the site's design and underlying code are much cleaner. But how do you keep all those HTML and XHTML tags and CSS values straight? Jennifer Niederst-Robbins, the author of our definitive guide on standards-compliant design, Web Design in a Nutshell, offers you the perfect little guide when you need answers immediately: HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference. This revised and updated new edition takes the top 20% of vital reference information from her Nutshell book, augments it judiciously, cross-references everything, and organizes it according to the most common needs of web developers. The result is a handy book that offers the bare essentials on web standards in a small, concise format that you can use carry anywhere for quick reference. This guide will literally fit into your back pocket. Inside HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference, you'll find instantly accessible alphabetical listings of every element and attribute in the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Recommendations.

And, knowing the basics of CSS is an essential ingredient for success. CSS for Print Designers presents web design concepts using metaphors that make sense to visual designers. Instead of using terms like semantics and structure, the book simplifies the language of web design using metaphors that print designers are comfortable with such as grouping like items or sculpting a layout from top to bottom or even how using sprites with CSS is like importing and cropping images in InDesign.

    "description": "Learning AngularJS Get started with AngularJS web development fast AngularJS is one of the most exciting and innovative new technologies emerging in the world of web development. Designed to simplify the development and testing of web applications, it also provides structure for the entire development process. Websites are no longer simple static content–instead, websites have become much more dynamic, with a single page often serving as the entire site or application. And AngularJS allows web developers to build the necessary programming logic for such applications directly into a web page, binding the data model for the client web application to backend services and databases. AngularJS also allows the extension of HTML so that the UI design logic can be expressed easily in an HTML template file. Learning AngularJS shows you how to create powerful, interactive web applications that have a well-structured, reusable code base that will be easy to maintain. You’ll also learn how to leverage AngularJS’s innovative MVC approach to implement well-designed and well-structured web pages and web applications. Understand how AngularJS is organized and learn best practices for designing AngularJS applications Find out how to define modules and utilize dependency injection Quickly build AngularJS templates with built-in directives that enhance the user experience Bind UI elements to your data model, so changes to your model and UI occur automatically in tandem Define custom AngularJS directives that extend HTML Implement zoomable images, expandable lists, and other rich UI components Implement client-side services that interact with web servers Build dynamic browser views to provide even richer user interaction Create custom services you can easily reuse Design unit and end-to-end tests for AngularJS applications Contents at a Glance 1 Jumping Into JavaScript Setting Up a JavaScript Development Environment Using Node.js Defining Variables Understanding JavaScript Data Types Using Operators Implementing Looping Creating Functions Understanding Variable Scope Using JavaScript Objects Manipulating Strings Working with Arrays Adding Error Handling 2 Getting Started with AngularJS Why AngularJS?

The course is divided into four modules. The first part—AngularJS Essentials is like a practical guide, filled with many step-by-step examples that will lead you through the best practices of AngularJS. After a brief introduction, you will learn how to create reusable components with directives. You will then take a look at many data handling techniques, discover a complete set of technologies that are capable to accomplish any challenge related to present, transform, and validate data on the user's interface. Finally, you will discover the best way to deal with the scope and how to break up the application into separate modules, giving rise to reusable and interchangeable libraries. With this you've crossed a milestone and are about to enter the world of learning by example. In the next part—Learning AngularJS By Example, you will learn how to effectively build apps using the AngularJS platform. You will be building multiple apps on this platform ranging from simple ones to more complex ones. In this module, you will roll up your coding sleeves and create a serious AngularJS application by example – a rich featured workout app. Take the coding a step at a time at first, then once you're coding a full app in this module, a lot of AngularJS will fall right into place for you. The third module—AngularJS Web Application Development Cookbook, will get you accustomed to the AngularJS concept armed with a solid understanding of how it works, insight into the best ways to wield it in real-world applications, and annotated code examples. It is a rich library of AngularJS coding solutions that you can use straight away in your own code projects. You are just a step away from completing this learning path of AngularJS. The name of the next part—MEAN Web Development itself assures that you are nearing the destination. The idea is simple with this part, you'll take MongoDB as the database, Express as the web framework, AngularJS as the frontend framework, and Node.js as the platform, and combine them together in a modular approach that will ensure the flexibility needed in modern software development. This is also your graduation to full-stack web development, which can open many new coding and career opportunities for you!

Some experience of modern tools such as Yeoman and Bower would be helpful, but is not a requirement. What You Will Learn Build and customize external HTML templates, and create simple, effective directives for common interface components Learn how to use Controller function and any Bootstrap UI directives to manipulate the DOM and how to transform any UI library into AngularJS directives Construct an AngularJS application to use shared components and validate your HTML5 Discover how to use jQuery events and manipulate the DOM using jQuery UI inside AngularJS applications Create custom directives for ongoing projects using Yeoman generators, and find out how to implement standalone directives Build reusable directives for Large AngularJS applications and extend directives to use dynamic templates Write unit test for directives using the Karma runner and Jasmine's behavior-driven development framework In Detail AngularJS directives are at the center of what makes it such an exciting – and important - web development framework. With directives, you can take greater control over HTML elements on your web pages – they 'direct' Angular's HTML compiler to behave in the way you want it to. It makes building modern web applications a much more expressive experience, and allows you to focus more closely on improving the way that user interaction impacts the DOM and the way your app manages data. If you're already using Angular, you probably recognize the power of directives to transform the way you understand and build your projects – but customizing and creating your own directives to harness AngularJS to its full potential can be more challenging. This cookbook shows you how to do just that – it's a valuable resource that demonstrates how to use directives at every stage in the workflow. Packed with an extensive range of solutions and tips that AngularJS developers shouldn't do without, you'll find out how to make the most of directives. You'll find recipes demonstrating how to build a number of different user interface components with directives, so you can take complete control over how users interact with your application. You'll also learn how directives can simplify the way you work by creating reusable directives – by customizing them with Yeoman you can be confident that you're application has the robust architecture that forms the bedrock of the best user experiences. You'll also find recipes that will help you learn how to unit test directives, so you can be confident in the reliability and performance of your application.
