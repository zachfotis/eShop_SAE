Lottie King has the best job in the world: catching killers.

Locked Room -- Determined to spend more time with the grands, homicide detective Lottie King volunteers with her granddaughter's Girl Power troop and teaches the girls how to solve the perfect murder, a homicide in a locked room where the killer had no plausible way out. Old Flame -- The twelve-year-old grandson of an old high school crush hires Detective Lottie King to find out what happened to his grandfather who is missing and probably dead, but no one believes him. Smooth Sailing -- On the eve of her retirement, Detective Lottie King investigates one last case for Colorado Springs Police, an accidental drowning that turns out to be murder.

Lottie King has the best job in the world: catching killers. But after a series of murder investigations leave her bruised and brokenhearted, is it finally time for this legendary Colorado Springs homicide detective to retire? Features four twisty mysteries and Lottie-inspired recipes. Rough Day -- Colorado Springs homicide detective Lottie King investigates the murder of a long-time friend and founder of a domestic violence shelter and finds herself frantically hunting down someone besides her friend's killer. Locked Room -- Determined to spend more time with the grands, homicide detective Lottie King volunteers with her granddaughter's Girl Power troop and teaches the girls how to solve the perfect murder, a homicide in a locked room where the killer had no plausible way out. Old Flame -- The twelve-year-old grandson of an old high school crush hires Detective Lottie King to find out what happened to his grandfather who is missing and probably dead, but no one believes him. Smooth Sailing -- On the eve of her retirement, Detective Lottie King investigates one last case for Colorado Springs Police, an accidental drowning that turns out to be murder.

Old Flame -- The twelve-year-old grandson of an old high school crush hires Detective Lottie King to find out what happened to his grandfather who is missing and probably dead, but no one believes him. Smooth Sailing -- On the eve of her retirement, Detective Lottie King investigates one last case for Colorado Springs Police, an accidental drowning that turns out to be murder.

    "description": "The second book in Alexander McCall Smith's new DETECTIVE VARG series . . . 'Reading the novel feels like a form of meditation . . . There is much to enjoy' Scotsman Spring is coming slowly to Sweden - though not quite as slowly as Detective Ulf Varg's promised promotion at the Department of Sensitive Crimes. For Varg, referred by his psychoanalyst to group therapy at Malmö's Wholeness Centre, life now seems mostly a circle of self-examination, something which may or may not be useful when it comes to the nature of his profession and the particularly sensitive cases that have recently come to light. All in a day's work for Detective Varg, except that one of his new investigations involves fellow detective Anna; it will require every ounce of self-discipline he has in order to remain professional. The other, more curious case is centred around internationally successful novelist Nils Personn-Cederström. According to his girlfriend, Cederström is being blackmailed - but by whom and for what reason? Accompanied by his irritating but kindly colleague Blomquist, Varg begins his enquiries and soon the answers fall neatly into place. Nothing and no one is ever that simple, however, and not for the first time he learns as much about his own emotional and moral landscape as he does about the motives of others. Now Varg must make a possibly life-changing decision. Will he choose his own happiness over that of his heart's desire?",

    "description": "The second book in Alexander McCall Smith's new DETECTIVE VARG series . . . 'Reading the novel feels like a form of meditation . . . There is much to enjoy' Scotsman Spring is coming slowly to Sweden - though not quite as slowly as Detective Ulf Varg's promised promotion at the Department of Sensitive Crimes. For Varg, referred by his psychoanalyst to group therapy at Malmö's Wholeness Centre, life now seems mostly a circle of self-examination, something which may or may not be useful when it comes to the nature of his profession and the particularly sensitive cases that have recently come to light. All in a day's work for Detective Varg, except that one of his new investigations involves fellow detective Anna; it will require every ounce of self-discipline he has in order to remain professional. The other, more curious case is centred around internationally successful novelist Nils Personn-Cederström. According to his girlfriend, Cederström is being blackmailed - but by whom and for what reason? Accompanied by his irritating but kindly colleague Blomquist, Varg begins his enquiries and soon the answers fall neatly into place. Nothing and no one is ever that simple, however, and not for the first time he learns as much about his own emotional and moral landscape as he does about the motives of others. Now Varg must make a possibly life-changing decision. Will he choose his own happiness over that of his heart's desire?",
